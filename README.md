Prime Graph - a program to plot the distribution of primes


Retriever - one of my first website scrapping programs, just used to understand web scrapping


Overall, this code defines a function retrieve that sends an HTTP request to a website, parses the HTML content, extracts prime numbers, and returns them as a list of integers. The prime numbers are identified by specific HTML elements on the web page with the class and title attributes set as specified in the code.


Trial division - implementation of the simplest deterministic primality test

n summary, the code attempts to find factors of the number n by iterating through potential divisors and prints whether n is prime or composite. It also measures the time taken for each factorization and creates a scatter plot of prime numbers against the time taken. The prime numbers used in this process are retrieved from an external source using the retrieve function.


piecewise-continuous-functions -Implement in Python a class of right-continuous functions with a finite number of values. In general, such a l function is defined as follows


OOP-quadratic-functions - I used this to relearn object orientated programming, created an object called quadratic that has a few methods. 
Class Definition:

The quadratic class is defined to represent quadratic functions.
The class has an __init__ method that takes three parameters: a, b, and c, which are the coefficients of the quadratic function.

value(x): This method calculates the value of the quadratic function at a given value of x.
solve(): This method finds the roots of the quadratic function using the quadratic formula and provides a statement indicating the nature of the roots.
globalM(): This method finds the global maximum or minimum of the quadratic function and provides a statement indicating its location.
plot(x1, x2): This method plots the quadratic function within the specified range of x values.
localM(x1, x2): This method finds local maximum and minimum points within a specified range and provides statements for their locations.

Overall, this code defines a class for quadratic functions and demonstrates how to use its methods to analyze and visualize quadratic functions, including finding roots, maximums, minimums, and creating plots.
